Hello ðŸ‘‹. Welcome to my page! I am a J.D./Ph.D. Candidate at the Northwestern University Pritzker School of Law & Department of Political Science. I am interested in legal doctrine, political change, and legal professionâ€”in post-socialist and common law countries. In my free time, I take pictures of things around.
